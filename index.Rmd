# Project overview

.font130[

### What's happening to gay neighborhoods across the United States, and why?

To answer, I examine patterns and variations in gayborhood trajectories in a broad, comparative way

# Motivation

.font120[

### Are gay neighborhoods really disappearing? 

Historical, ethnographic, & interview research provides evidence for **cultural and institutional changes** in some gay enclaves  
.font50[e.g. *There Goes the Gayborhood?* (Ghaziani 2014), *Boystown* (Orne 2017)]

Popular & media narratives suggest **assimilation and gentrification** as culprits, linking cultural changes to **demographic and economic** factors

This framing implies processes *unique to* gay neighborhoods are at play

.font150[Challenges]

]

.pull-right.font130[

No systematic way to define and identify gay neighborhoods

<br/>

No data on LGBTQ populations at small geographies  
(and data on same-sex couple households aren't adequate)

# Approach

.font120[

1. *Define and identify gay neighborhoods*

	**&rarr;** clusters of gay bars from a 2007 digital archive
	
2. *Examine their characteristics over time*

	**&rarr;** American Community Survey data from 2006-2015
	
3. *Compare them to other places*

  **&rarr;** linear models of Census tracts, matched within cities

# Outcomes

### 7 indicators of social, demographic, and economic change

From the American Community Survey (5-year) for 2006-2010 and 2011-2015

general measures of urban change: 

- proportion college-educated
- median income
- median rent
- proportion white

measures specific to gender and sexuality: 

- proportion male
- proportion different-sex married-couple households

a necessary control:

- population density

# Analysis

### Descriptive: 

Visualize the trajectories of gay neighborhoods, and compare them to each other

### Statistical:

Compare gay neighborhoods to other places using linear models of the 7 measures of change:

$$x_{2011-2015} = \alpha + \beta_1 gay + \beta_2 x_{2006-2010} +X\beta_{controls} + \epsilon$$

What's a fair comparison? Two methods beyond linear regression: 

1. **matching tracts** on 2006-2010 covariates (using Mahalanobis distance)
2. **multilevel models** (varying intercepts by city)

# Conclusions

.font120[

Demographic and economic change in gay neighborhoods is **not intense or widespread**

Observed changes are **largely not distinct** from other urban places — change in education levels excepted

Gayborhoods are subject to the same urban processes as other places — they differ in their **symbolic impact** for LGBTQ people

]

---
# Implications

.font120[

*What are the stakes of this work?*

These places deeply matter to groups of people, who fear losing them; this work shows that's not happening everywhere

*Where should we look to explain what's happening to gay enclaves?*

Changes often seem more about local urban forces; policies aimed at mitigating change likely need to be specialized

# Extensions

### Historical data

- the decennial Census (2000 &rarr; 2010)
- other listings of gay institutions (e.g., the Damron travel guides)

Ideally, the ACS would ask a question about sexual orientation — but that's only good for answering similar questions in the future

### Statistical improvements

- Poisson regression of rates
- Temporal modeling can be improved; spatial component is fine

### Perceptions of gay neighborhoods

Survey people in different cities: where do they think gay neighborhoods are? How do they know? What are their perceptions of change?
